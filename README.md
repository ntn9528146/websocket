# websocket
I have created this project with the help of Vs Code and have created two folders in it.
To open this you need to install React.

key feature:

1. client folder: 
2. server folder

1. client folder:
   a. chat windows : 
   b. Join chat rooms:
2. Server
   In this I have used socket so that users can connect with each other.
